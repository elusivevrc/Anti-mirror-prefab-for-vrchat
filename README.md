Hey so this is my prefab i made for the funny :)
Demo avi if you wanna try before applying on avi: temp unavailable .
Its a simple [vrcfury](https://vrcfury.com/) prefab that uses [cancerspace](https://github.com/AkaiMage/VRC-Cancerspace) shader only uses about 1000 polys and 1 mat slot.
The prefab comes with 5 images slot by default you just modify the image in the shader
Dont forget to import vrcfury and cancerspace.![funny](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3e32a0d-fb57-462d-91b1-c9253448a928)
Example image of what it does.
To make it optimised i use a size slider so by default its very small and uses a the slider to make it very big (no idea how big but wayyyyy bigger than most maps)
Anyway have fun with it.
